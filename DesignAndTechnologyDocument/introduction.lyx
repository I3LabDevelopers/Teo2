Robotic companions have been proven effective to promote social skills and

 behavior that can help to form better relationships with people.
 Moreover, it is interesting to explore the effect of these emotionally-enhanced
 robotic companions with children that are subject of Neurodevelopmental
 Disorders (NDD) and the value the robots can bring within the therapy sessions
 that are conducted with these children.

, the emotional evolution of the Teo that was result of the KROG Project.
 To exploit the twofold functionality of Teo, that of a playful companion
 for the children and that of a tool for the therapist, a set of behavior
 and functionalities were added to render this robot more emotionally consisting
 with the environment stimili and the interaction with the children.
 Also a set of functions were designed to put in the therapists' hands the
 control necessary for them to include Teo in their therapy sessions.
