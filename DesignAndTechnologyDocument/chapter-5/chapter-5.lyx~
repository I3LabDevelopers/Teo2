\begin_layout Standard
The work realize with Teo2 was a challenge from its beginning, since designing
 possible interaction scenarios with children and a robot to the fact of
 actually working on the implementation of such designs.
 The natural multidisciplinarity of the project allowed the exploration
 of ideas corresponding to fields varying from human-robot interaction,
 psichology, robotics, electronics and computer science.
 And as any challange, it brought learning and difficulties that finally
 lead to the results stated in the present document.
 In the present chapter the challenges affronted are stated and the results
 accomplished are discussed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Platform-related difficulties
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The platform that was received to work on the interactions scenarios was
 far from fully functional, that is, the subsystems had problems ranging
 from lack of drivers implementation to electronics issues.
 Henceforth, a significant amount of time was taken to design and develop
 solutions to turn the systems functional for the scenarios development.
 However, many problems were solved and/or alleviated to allow for the implement
ation of the Talk2Teo scenario.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Among the problems solved where many false-contacts throughout the electronics
 that made unreliable the reading of sensors as the sonar and the Sharp
 IR, the remapping of the motors pins that did not allow for the appropiate
 control of the speed and, hence, there was no control over the direction
 and speed of Teo; implementation of a position controller to allow for
 automatic behaviors being able to change its orientation and position in
 the space according to the behavior's logic, introduction of the PC in
 the control loop of Teo to allow the handling of diverse input and output
 controlling signals –joypad controller, audio speaker and Teo control and
 setup– and evaluation of the power consumption of the system.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In other account, the work to be done in the platform was divided between
 to teams, not all the subsystems were checked and, hence, the implementation
 of behaviors depending on the force sensors (FSR: Force Sensitive Resistor)
 as reaction to hugs, hits and caresses could not be implemented in the
 allotted time.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, one of the bigger difficulties is presented in the following subsection
, as it was the more complex problem and it led to leave unimplemented one
 of the scenarios proposed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Marcopolo scenarios implementation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To provide Teo with semi-autonomous ways to interact with the children the
 Marcopolo scenarios were proposed, that is, the introduction of autonomous
 gaming interaction aimed to provide mechanisms for the child and Teo shared
 a structured activity that would promote the comfortabily and the getting-accos
tumed phase.
 However, the implementation of these scenarios were strongly delayed by
 technological limitations of the platform designed to be Teo2.
 Their realization was heavily hindered by the development of a sound localizati
on algorithm with the enough accuracy to provide even an acceptable performance
 of the game.
 The legacy implementation received was thought to fail because of the microphon
es, however, the information extracted from the sound signals to be used
 by this algorithm was too little (only a trio of single-point amplitude
 measurements that were too susceptible to noise) to expect a robust enough
 localization of the source sound.
 To improve the algorithm, it was taken the more sensible option available
 to achieve the desire precision in the sound source localization; that
 was that of using an Interaural Time Difference approach that bases the
 estimation of the position in the delay between the signals measured by
 the trio of microphones.

Nevertheless, to implement this solution, three main problems with the computati
onal platform (Arduino) were encountered during its implementation: memory,
 computational power and ADC sampling rate.
 The maximum sampling rate possible with the Arduino Mega in Teo2 was 50kHz
 only sampling one signal, in order to sample the three microphones the
 sample rate would reduce to ~16kHz that would be too little for the bandwith
 of the sound signals, thus, producing aliasing that would affect the reliabilit
y of the computations.
 Moreover, the time step between samples of the signal of 1/16kHz would
 not provide the resolution required to measure the delay between the signals
 with enough accuracy –contrained by the distance between the microphones,
 which determine the delay between the signals.
 On the other hand, the memory in the Arduino Mega (8MB) was not enough
 to store more than ~64ms of each signal (sampled at 16kHz), thus it cause
 the reduction of the amount of information available to run the algorithm.
 Finally, the computation of the delay for this little sample resulted in
 completely erroneous results that took ~3sec to process for just 64ms of
 data.
 The possible efficient computations through the use of the FFT (Fast Fourier
 Transform) were not possible because the memory was not enough to even
 execute it, however, the floating point arithmetic in the Arduino Mega
 microcontroller is slow, so it was not guaranteed an improvement in processing
 time.
 Finally, the possibility to realize this signal processing in the external
 PC was descarted because with the Bluetooth module as the only communication
 link, the data rate available was not enough to allow a real-time algorithm.

\begin_layout Section
Results and Conclusions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The work done to try and implement the Talk2Teo and Marcopolo scenarios,
 as mentioned above, led to realize many correcting actions on the platform,
 redesign and implementation of old and new features that make the platform
 of Teo2 more easily handled and can lead to the initiative of development
 of other projects to create new and better interactions and provide improvement
s to the platform itself.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Talk2Teo, the scenario implemented to completion, represents the solution
 proposed to enhance Teo with a mechanism that puts in the hands of the
 therapist a total control of the functionalities that are part of this
 robot.
 This kind of control should allow Teo to be a useful and desirable tool
 for the therapist, that is, the solution developed looks to satisfy the
 need of the therapist to have a technological tool that allows them to
 provide to the children rewards, reinforcement, guidance and examples in
 a manner that the children are comfortable with a limited and controlled
 stimuli production –as it happens when Teo is used.
 Moreover, Teo was equipped with the ability to use its small model of the
 environment in a way to generate reactions and behaviors that can make
 him likable and interactive to the children.
 Even the voice and the design of the facial expressions where re-done to
 ensure a more easy way for these special children learn to recognize Teo's
 emotions and to understand the actions that triggered them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this way, this first solution approaches to solve the comprehensive situation
 in which Teo satisfy the twofold goal to be the technological tool that
 therapists can use during its therapy sessions and that the way Teo reacts,
 behaves and interact can successfully allow the children to like it to
 be used in their sessions; a tool that the therapist wants to use is incomplete
 if the children simply do not want to have them used.
 And even though, the prototype here presented is still to be evaluated,
 the implementation done ensures full scalability and simple redesign of
 the features; thus, providing a platform that can evolve positively and
 in an efficient manner with the feedback from its users and stakeholders.
 All in all, the prototype here developed has the characteristics to neccesary
 to satisfied the needs of its users while fully extendable and capable
 to be adapted and including in future more complex artificial intelligence
 for this robotic companion for the NDD children.
