\begin_body

\begin_layout Standard
As an extension of the previous version, the context of use is also in a
 therapy session in a sufficiently large room to be shared by the child
 and Teo.
 However, the room must also be equipped with some technology to support
 this game: monitor/projector and RFID-tagged objects.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The basic premise of the game is based on the use of sound guidance that
 is core of the Marcopolo game.
 However, the target to be reach by Teo is different: Teo must be guided
 by the child to pass through different positions in the room following
 a determined sequence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For this version, the participation of the therapist will be kept as before,
 being an observer of the game and control Teo, in case it is necessary.
 Also, provide the reinforcement and guidance when the child needs it to
 start/continue with the game.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subparagraph
Goal
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The goal of the game is to help the child to associate the sequence presented
 to a spatial relation with physical objects and positions in space, in
 addition to generating a dynamic in which the interaction between the child
 and Teo can become more natural and comfortable.

Dynamic of the game

\begin_layout Standard
Teo and the child, as before, need to share a sufficiently large space to
 move around.
 With a

 Teo, the game starts and Teo begins explaining to the child the dynamic
 of the game: Teo narrates that the child has an important task to realize
 in which he has to try to guide it (Teo) through a series of points where
 he must go.
 But as Teo cannot see, must be done with the voice.
 Teo prompts the child to answer out loud 
\begin_inset Quotes fld
\end_inset

Teo, here!
\begin_inset Quotes frd
\end_inset

 whenever it asks 
\begin_inset Quotes fld
\end_inset

Where are you?
\begin_inset Quotes frd
\end_inset

.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

A projector will show a sequence of checkpoints that must be followed, identifie
d, for instances, with colored circles distributed around the room.
 After the explanation and the sequence to follow revealed, the game can
 get started.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

The child must move to the corresponding checkpoint and call 
\begin_inset Quotes fld
\end_inset

Teo, here!

 so Teo could start moving in his direction.

Whenever Teo arrives to a correct checkpoint, congratulates the child happily
 and prompts him to keep doing a great job.
 When, instead, Teo arrives to an incorrect checkpoint it prompts the child
 to verify if he is where he should be.

\end_inset

The game ends when Teo reaches the final checkpoint in which Teo happily
 praise the child with a combination of lighting, faces, sound and images
 displayed in the monitor/projector.

\begin_layout Subparagraph
Technological Feasibility and requirements.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As this game is an extension of the previous version of Marcopolo, then,
 it depends in the same technological requirements.
 The additional constraints and requirements are the ones stated below.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
In order to allow Teo to be able to recognize the correctness of its position,
 the checkpoints must be identified.
 For instance, using RFID is possible to do this and, therefore, and RFID
 tag reader must added to the hardware infrastructure of Teo.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A projector and/or a monitor big enough must be available in the room to
 allow the display of information important for the development of the game.
