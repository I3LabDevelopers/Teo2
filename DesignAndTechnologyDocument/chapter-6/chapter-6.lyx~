What was left
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
During the development of this project many constraints and limitations
 were encountered.
 The principal ones were time and the state of the hardware infrastructure
 received.
 Even though many issues were solved and functionalities implemented, there
 are still some that remained to be done.
 Among them are the execution of the evaluation plans, functionalities to
 support recollection of data from the interactions and even the implementation
 of the Marcopolo scenario of interaction proposed in this document.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The implementation of the Marcopolo scenario was heavily hindered by the
 development of a sound localization algorithm with the enough affidability
 to provide even an acceptable performance.
 The legacy implementation received was thought to fail because of the microphon
es, however, the information extracted from the sound signals to be used
 by this algorithm was too little (only single amplitude measurements that
 are too susceptible to noise) to expect a robust enough localization of
 the source sound.
 To improve the algorithm, it was taken the more sensible option available
 to achieve the desire precision in the sound source localization that was
 that of using an Interaural Time Difference approach that bases the estimation
 of the position in the delay between the signals measured by the triple
 of microphones.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, to implement this solution three main problems with the computational
 platform (Arduino) were encountered during its implementation: memory,
 computational power and ADC sampling rate.
 The maximum sampling rate possible with the Arduino Mega in Teo2 was 50
 kHz only sampling one signal, in order to sample the three microphones
 the sample rate would reduce to ~16kHz that would be too little for the
 bandwith of the sound signals, thus, producing aliasing that would affect
 the reliability of the computations.
 Moreover, the time step between samples of the signal of 1/16kHz would
 not provide the resolution required to measure the delay between the signals
 with enough accuracy.
 On the other hand, the memory in the Arduino Mega (8MB) was not enough
 to store more than ~64ms of each signal (sampled at 16kHz) and for it was
 reduced the amount of information available to run the algorithm.
 Finally, the computation of the delay for this little sample resulted in
 completely erroneous results that took ~3sec to process for just 64ms of
 data.
 The possible efficient computations through the use of the FFT (Fast Fourier
 Transform) was not possible because the memory was not enough to even execute
 it, however, the floating point arithmetic in the Arduino Mega microcontroller
 is slow, so it was not guaranteed an improvement in processing time.
 Finally, the possibility to realize this signal processing in the external
 PC was descarted because with Bluetooth module as the only communication
 link the data rate was not enough to provide a real-time algorithm.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given the lack of a sound localization algorithm, the Marcopolo scenario
 was decided to be left yet implemented.
 Even though, the dynamic can be simulated using the manual control provided
 by the

 functionalities, the autonomous proposed behavior was not possible within
 the time frame of the present project.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By the end, it was proposed to implement a logger to collect data during
 the interaction situations with Teo2 containing information of the behaviors
 executed, some sensors measurement and the time to provide support for
 the evaluation activities.
 However, due to the time contraints, it was not implemented.

 better engagement of the children (even if a synthesized voice allow to
 modify the sentences more easly).

Teo2 model leaves space to many possibilities in terms of usage and advantages
 within the therapy.
 Several new games and interaction can be designed using Teo2, thanks to
 its versatility.
