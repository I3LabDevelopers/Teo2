What was left
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the lack of time, unfortunaately we hadn't implemented a logger of data
 (about distance and touch) collected by the Teo sensors.

A big issue has occured during the development of the sound localization
 code.
 Arduino can sample at 50kHz, that means 50kB/s, that force us to sample
 for 100ms because of the saturation of the memory.
 Moreover, sampling from 3 microphones simultaneously means to divide the
 frequency (50kHz/3=16kHz), which could produce aliasing for the Nyquist
 theorem (if the nput signal has a frequency of more than 8kHz).
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Furthemore, sampling only 100ms don't let to understand which of the 3 signal
 come first (Interaural Time Difference algorithm).

This was the main reason for which we could not complete

Future directions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our solution is still far from its potential.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Arduino could be replaced with a Raspberry Pi 3 or an Intel Edison, which
 would allow Teo to easely compute digital signal processing, in order to
 deal with

Finally, Teo could have enough resources in order to have an artificial
 intelligence, which would allow Teo to be a companion in the children life,
 not

 a tool used by a therapist.

The synthesized voice could be replaced with a real one in order to get
 better engagement of the children (even if a synthesized voice allow to
 modify the sentences more easly).
